# BUK Tech Hack

During the BUK Romjulscamp 2022 you'll learn web security. The first day we'll together do a walkthrough of Google Gruyere. The second day we'll let you compete in an actual CTF.

## Warning

If you plan to participate, please don't look at these files ahead of time. During the activity you can use the scripts in the gruyere folder and the presentation, but please don't look ahead. You won't learn anything that way.
